# Summary

Finally it can be said that the model does not meet the necessary requirements to be used to predict the effectiveness of money invested in organizations as it only predicts between 72% and 74% of the ones that are succesful. 

Another model is reccomended to keep testing this dataset as to prove two things:

The dataset is enough to convey a good predcition.

The deep learning model can still be modified as to get a better result without overfitting the data.

Random Forest Classifier is reccomended as it has as good of precision as deep learning and also it is faster to implement and it could be useful to better conclude about the datset, if maybe the data is not enough or maybe if neural network does not adjust itself to this case. Any case it is good to have comparissons for future reference.
